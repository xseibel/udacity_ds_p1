This project is about analyzing the relationship between salary, job satisfaction and years of programming of developers from the US. This analysis is based on the data of Stackoverflowâ€™s 2017 Annual Developer Survey.
The conclusion of the analysis is, that there is a correlation between salary and job satisfaction, however the causality is not clear. There is also a clear trend between salary and years of programming. A little trend is seen between job satisfaction and years of programming.
